In order to change the size os a header, you will have to put hashtags based on how big or small you want the text. If you want to increase the size of the text, you will have to increrase the amount of hashtags. There is a maximum of 6 hashtags.


For example:

// # This is the largest text you can use.    
// ###### This is the smallest text you can use. 

Will show:

# This is the largest text you can use.
###### This is the smallest text you can use.

### Adding Url to Code
In order to add a url to your code you will have to put open and closed brackets around what you would like the link to be named then follow that with the link to the website in parenthesis. 

For example:

[ Google ] (https://www.google.com)

Will show:

[Google](https://www.google.com)


### Adding Image to Code 
In order to add an image to your code you will have to put an exclamation point, followed by a pair of bracket with "alt text" in between the brackets. After,  "![alt text]" you will then put the link to the photo in parenthesis.


For Example:

[alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Siberischer_tiger_de_edit02.jpg)


As the final product:

| !             | @             | #     |
Will show:
